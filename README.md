# Smooth Cursor for Obsidian

I personally love the cursor animations and transitions in VSCode, so here's a simple plugin that replicates that effect in Obsidian! This plugin adds smooth cursor animations to your editor, aside from some other bells and whistles to customize your caret (and your experience)

## Features

- ✨ Smooth cursor movement anims! With custom easing functions
- 🎛️ Customizable caret width + fading cursor animation, instead of the usual blinking
- 🔄 Toggle on/off via command palette

## Manual Installation

1. Download the BRAT from the Obsidian Community plugins, and add this plugin from by copying this repository's link (In BRAT: Options -> Add Beta plugin -> Paste repo's URL).
2. Enable the plugin in Settings → Community Plugins

## Dev Installation

Clone this repository into your vault's plugins folder, then

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev build (watches for changes)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

And enable the plugin in Obsidian
